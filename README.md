# Deep Learning Implementations

Hands-on implementations of deep learning models, experiments, and notes.

## 📁 Structure
- **Datasets** → Sample data or links
- **Notebooks** → Jupyter notebooks with models & experiments
- **Notes** → Theory, paper summaries, quick explanations

## Topics
- Neural networks & backpropagation
- CNNs (LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet)
- Transfer learning
- Image classification
- ...and more (work in progress)

## Tech Stack
Python, PyTorch, Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
```bash
